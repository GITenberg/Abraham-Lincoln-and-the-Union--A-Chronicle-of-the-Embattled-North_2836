description: 'BCR''s Shelf2Life American Civil War Collection is a unique and exciting
  collection of pre-1923 titles focusing on the American Civil War and the people
  and events surrounding it. From memoirs and biographies of notable military figures
  to firsthand accounts of famous battles and in-depth discussions of slavery, this
  collection is a remarkable opportunity for scholars and historians to rediscover
  the experience and impact of the Civil War. The volumes contained in the collection
  were all written within 60 years of the end of the war, which means that most authors
  had living memory of it and were facing the effects of the war while writing. These
  firsthand accounts allow the modern reader to more fully understand the culture
  of both the Union and Confederacy, the politics that governed the escalation and
  end of the war, the personal experience of life during the Civil War, and the most
  difficult and polarizing question in the history of the United States: slavery.
  The American Civil War Collection allows new readers access to the contemporary
  arguments and accounts surrounding the war, and is a vital new tool in understanding
  this important and pivotal chapter in American history.'
